## Recipes

We collect user submitted installation scripts and config file templates for platforms we don't support officially.
We believe there is merit in allowing a certain amount of diversity.
You can get and submit your solution to running/configuring GitLab with your favorite OS/distro, database, web server, cloud hoster, configuration management tool, etc.
